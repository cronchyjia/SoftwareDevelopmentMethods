# SoftwareDevelopmentMethods
Contains all four assignments of my software development course with screenshots of input and output of each assignment. This showcases my personal growth as the first course where I coded assignments completely on my own (without a template written from the professors).
Comparing the first assignment to the last there is a clear improvement of control flow, visually cleaner code, and use of comments.
The course also taught me how to use Unix comand lines.
