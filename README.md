# SoftwareDevelopmentMethods
Contains the first and final assignments to my software development course. This is to showcase my personal growth as the first course where I coded assignments completely on my own (without a template written from the professors).
Comparing the first assignment to the last there is a clear improvement of control flow, visually cleaner code, and use of comments.
